# Yutvil

It's just a simple project for our family real estate agency
which automatically fills up a sales agreement and saves it to the computer 
so the lawyer does not have to fill all the empty spaces manually every time there is a new client coming to the agency. 

I know it does not look great and it should have been done using classes and responsive interface but 
I only had around a week to study all the libraries I used in this project and actually write it. (I had to start my AWS re/start full-time program).  

Libraries that I have never used before and started this project just to play around with them in the first place: 
Tkinter (GUI), Mailmerge (Word documents editing), PIL (background image) and Pyinstaller (.py to .exe)
